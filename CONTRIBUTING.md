###### Tip:

:bulb: You can also remedy any issues yourself instantly by simply disabling Adblock Plus for that certain website/page in your ad blocker's menu.

###### Note:

:bulb: **Seeing some unblocked ads while using Blockzilla?** This is because in some cases I can't have access to certain websites to create ad blocking filters due to those websites having regional/country specific restrictions or require a login account (webmail, social media, etc.).

 :bulb: If that is so, you can easily hide any unblocked ads that you see by using the ["Element Hiding Helper for Adblock Plus".](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elemhidehelper/)
