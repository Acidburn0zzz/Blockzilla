###### Tip:

:bulb: Remedy any issues yourself instantly, by simply disabling Adblock Plus for that certain website in your ad blocker's menu.

###### Notes:

:grey_exclamation: Blockzilla uses the Adblock Plus filter syntax and ideally should be used with Adblock Plus for the intended/optimal performance. However, Blockzilla can be used with other ad blockers that support the Adblock Plus filter syntax.

:grey_exclamation: **Untick the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" checkbox in Adblock Plus:**

:one: Click on the red "ABP" icon.

:two: Click on "Filter preferences" (Firefox) or "Options" (Chrome).

:three: Untick the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" checkbox.

:bulb: **Still seeing some unblocked ads while using Blockzilla?** This is because in some cases I can't have access to certain websites to create ad blocking filters due to those websites having regional/country specific restrictions or require a login account (webmail, social media, etc.).

 :bulb: Hide unblocked ads yourself by using the ["Element Hiding Helper for Adblock Plus".](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elemhidehelper/)
