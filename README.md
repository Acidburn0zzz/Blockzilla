- Blockzilla is an advertisement and tracker blocking filter list subscription. Used with an ad blocking web browser extension such as Adblock Plus, Blockzilla makes you have a **better** web browsing experience.

- The benefits of having ads blocked while viewing websites eliminates annoying, distracting and inappropriate advertisements, making websites load **faster**.

- Blockzilla also makes your internet browsing **safer** and more private by blocking tracking techniques that are used by most websites to learn about your online behaviour.

- Blockzilla is an unbloated and **slim list**, being light on system resources, yet still powerful against ads and trackers. 

- Blockzilla aims to have a low risk for false positives. However, as is the nature with all ad blocking and privacy protection lists, false positives can occur, causing content on certain websites to be mistakenly blocked while browsing. If that is the case, you can remedy it instantly by simply disabling Adblock Plus for that specific website in your ad blocker's menu or you can report issues to me.
