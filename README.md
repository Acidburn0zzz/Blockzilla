- The benefits of having ads and trackers blocked while viewing websites eliminates annoying, distracting and inappropriate advertisements making websites load **faster** and above all makes for a **better** browsing experience.

- Blockzilla also makes your internet browsing **safer** and more private by blocking tracking techniques used by most websites to learn about your online behaviour.

This is achieved in part by avoiding many site specific rules and focusing more on generic rules for a wider range of effectiveness while still keeping the balance of having a low risk for false positives.

If that is the case, you can remedy it instantly by simply disabling Adblock Plus for that certain website/page in your ad blocker's menu or you can [report issues here](https://github.com/zpacman/Blockzilla/issues), see [support policy](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
