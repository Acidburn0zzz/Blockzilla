# Blockzilla

- Blockzilla is an advertisement and tracker blocking filter list subscription for use with an ad blocking web browser extension such as Adblock Plus.

- The benefits of having ads and trackers blocked while viewing websites eliminates annoying, distracting and inappropriate advertisements making websites load **faster** and overall makes for a **better** browsing experience.

- Blockzilla also makes your internet browsing **safer** by blocking tracking techniques used by most websites to learn about your online behaviour.

- Blockzilla is designed to be powerful and effective against ads and trackers while still maintaining to be an unbloated and slim list. This is achieved by avoiding many site specific rules and focusing more on generic rules for a wider range of effectiveness while still keeping the balance of having a low risk for false positives. 

- As is the nature with all ad blocking and privacy protection lists, false positives can occur, causing content on certain websites to be mistakenly blocked while browsing. If that is the case, you can remedy it instantly by simply disabling Adblock Plus for that certain website/page in your ad blocker's menu or you can [report issues to me here](https://github.com/zpacman/Blockzilla/issues).
